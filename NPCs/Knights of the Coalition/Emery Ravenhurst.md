On a failed save, a creature takes 40 (9d8) damage of the chosen type and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.

### Bio 
Emery Ravenhurst is a fair skinned human woman at around 23 years of age. She has short black hair and black irises, and usually wears round glasses due to her near-sightedness. Her usual attire is a white button-down with a black tie and blue-gray sweater vest. She often wears a dark gray blazer over them. She can also be found a single golden star hanging from a short chain as an earing 

As a mage in the [[The Coalition|Coalition's]] reserve corps, she's adept at the school of magic known as cosmolurgy. Her [[Magic|magic]] passively manifests around her as little dots and lines representing constellations. In places where magical energy is abundant, she will often carry an aura of various constellations surrounding her head, fading in and out of existence. More powerful spells also take the form of stars, although on a more intense scale. She can manifest spheres of blazing hot plasma as an offensive weapon, although the greaterthey are in magnitude and intensity, the more energy it takes. 
Although currently only in the reserve corps, Emery has had a successful military career. Having served 2 tours of duty in [[General Alexandra Sunnea|General Sunnea's]] campaign in the [[The Western Isles|Western Isles]], she has proven herself not only as a cappable warrior-mage but as a skilled scholar and tactician. Many of her strategies in the field lead to decisive victories in key battles, such as in the [[Battle of Arrowhead Ridge]]. Nowadays one can find her in the [[Capital]]'s great [[Hildegunn Library]] conducting her research. Her latest project is uncovering the history of  [[Apollo Silverborn]] and his mythicized excecution of a singularity. Her current lead has to do with the mysterious [[Origin Well]], where it is rumored that Apollo was able to accumulate enough energy to successfuly cast the spell without depleting his own energy.
