### Bio 
Major General of the [[Legion of Knights|Legion]] Alexandra Sunnea is a dark-skinned middle aged Human woman. She has jet-black curly hair with streaks of white, and sports a scar running along the bottom of her jaw from a battle now long past. One will rarely see her outside of her officer's uniform, whose epulet is decorated with various medals and patches from her various victories. 

General Sunnea is a revered strategist, known for the often unorthodox but effective strategies that have earned her the title of victor in many a battle. She is most famous for her campaign in [[The Western Isles]], where she gained recognition converting her capital ship, *[[Victory's Reward]]*, and the rest of her fleet into a fully mobile command center which she used to deadly effect. Beyond her expertise at strategy, Alexandra is also a skilled fighter, and will rarely turn down any sparring challenge. She often favors polearms, and is known for sporting her signature weapon: an ornate glaive passed down through her family enchanted with the ability to control fire, a trait she takes great advantage of.
