The evoker can select up to three creatures it can see in the area to ignore the spell, as the evoker sculpts the spell's energy around them. On a failed save, a creature takes 40 (9d8) damage of the chosen type and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone."
