# 1. A Call To Adventure
### Overview
This will help introduce the player characters to the setting and all it has to offer. It's also good to help players new to the game learn the ropes, with relatively easy combat encounters and lots of opportunities for roleplaying. They'll be approached by Gordon Vikhammer of the [[Legion of Knights]] for help in recovering an important asset after helping stop a bandit who was stealing from a local merchant at the Briar Hollow town plaza. If they accept, they'll be given a location to a forest outside of town where they'll eventually find a group of 3 goblins, which they'll begin an [[#Encounter|encounter]] with. After they defeated the goblins and grabbed the intel, they'll be able to head back to town where they'll give Gordon the intel. He will then reward them each 5 Gp (or another suitable reward of your choosing). He will then offer them the possibility for more commisions on behalf of the Legion. He then tells them to head to the Legion's office in the capital if they decide to take up his offer. (**[[2. Whispers in the Dark|Next Misson]]**)
