# The Coalition
Formerly a suprnational organization created by 4 founding states, it blended over time into a single state after the boundaries seperating its members eroded with time. Made up of 6 provinces, The Coalition is the dominant political force on the west side of the continent. With each of the absorbed states having had certain specialized imports and exports, The Coalition is completely self sufficient and only relies on imported goods for certain rare materials.
