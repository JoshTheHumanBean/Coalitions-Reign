The [[Coaliton|Coalition's]] academics sector is world renowned for its innovations in magecraft and technology. In the world of [[Asperod]], magic is treated as a scientific study in the sense that it's a study of the rules and inner workings of the world around them. Here, magic and science as we know it in our world are closely intertwined under the field of [[Gnoscientia]], which encompasses all learning that applies logic and reasoning.
